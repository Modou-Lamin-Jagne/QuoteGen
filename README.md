# QuoteGen

A simple web app for generating random Tech related quotes.

I created this app just out of curiousity. I wantd to have some idea about how ChatGPT works, so I ask it to generate the code.
It didn't come exactly how I wanted it but it was really amazing. So I decided to modify it a little to fit well.

It is built purely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and some Bootstrap.
To get the app all you need to do is to clone the repo or download the zip file.
